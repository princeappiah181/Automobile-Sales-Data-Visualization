**Automobile Sales Analysis Visualization**

This repository contains the project for analyzing historical automobile sales data, particularly during recession periods. The goal of this project is to create informative and visually appealing plots 
that communicate insights from the data,using Matplotlib,Seaborn and Folium  for data visualization.

**Project Overview**

In this project, I analyze historical automobile sales data to understand sales trends during periods of recession. Through visualizations, I aim to communicate insights regarding the impacts of recession periods 
on automobile sales and provide a visual representation of historical trends.

**Key Tasks:**
- Analyze historical automobile sales data.
- Create visually appealing and informative plots.
- Identify trends in automobile sales, especially during recession periods.
- Customize visualizations to effectively communicate insights.
  
**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project contains information about automobile sales over several years, including key features like:
Recession: A binary variable indicating recession perion; 1 means it was recession, 0 means it was normal.
Automobile_Sales: The number of vehicles sold during the period.
Month: Month of the observation extracted from Date.
Year: Year of the observation extracted from Date.
Economic indicators (e.g., GDP, unemployment rates)

The dataset can be found in the datasets/ folder of this repository.


**Visualization Tools Used**

Matplotlib: Used for creating basic plots and graphs.
Seaborn: Used for more advanced visualizations, such as heatmaps and distribution plots.
Folium:Used to create interactive maps

**How to Use**
- Open the Jupyter notebook Automobile_Sales_Analysis.ipynb.
- Follow the steps within the notebook to explore and visualize the data.
- Customize the visualizations based on your preferences (color schemes, labels, etc.).
